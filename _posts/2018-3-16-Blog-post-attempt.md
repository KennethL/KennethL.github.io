Every week I will try to make a new blog post about something interesting regarding Erlang/OTP.

Today the 16:th of March the CodeBeam conference in San Francisco is taking place with many interesting talks.
There is one talk about the "Latest News from OTP" and another about `gen_statem` the state machine behavior
replacing the old `gen_fsm`.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
