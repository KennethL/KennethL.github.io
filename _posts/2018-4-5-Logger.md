title: Logger a new logging API
---

## Introduction
This is just a test so far, the text below is just example text.

## Background
The main goal is to standardize an API for logging, allowing the application implementer to use this API without
making any assumptions about the logging backend that will be used in the final system. 
That is, we want to remove the dependency on source code level between applications and logging facility. 
The goal is not to remove the need for good logging applications like Lager, 
but to lift the decision about logging from the low level application implementer to the high level system architect. 
This will also make it easier to combine applications from different providers - since the same API is always used. 
Thus individual applications don't need a dependency to a logging backend such as Lager. 
That dependency is decided on system level instead.

We want a built-in logging feature which is "good" by default, but which can be customized and extended if needed.

```erlang
-module(m).
-compile(export_all).

foo(A) when is_atom(A) ->
  atom_to_list(A).
```
