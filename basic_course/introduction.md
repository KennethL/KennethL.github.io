Welcome!

In this basic course, we are going to teach you about Erlang fundamentals - the language syntax, how to define modules,
how to manipulate the common data structures, and more. 
This chapter will focus on how to make sure that Erlang is properly installed so that you can access Erlang's
Interactive Shell, started with the `erl` command.

We assume yoou have Erlang version 21.0 or newer.

Let's get started!
